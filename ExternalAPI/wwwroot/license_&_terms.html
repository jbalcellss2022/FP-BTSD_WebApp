														You may not use the ODM Web API and may not accept the Terms if (a)
														you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with ODM, or

														If you are accessing or using the ODM Web API on behalf of an entity,
														you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that
														entity to the Terms and by accepting the Terms, you are doing so on
														behalf of that entity (and all references to “you” in the Terms refer
														to that entity).

													any information that the Receiving Party can establish: (a) was
													generally available to the public (or becomes so) without the fault or
													negligence of the Receiving Party, (b) was known by or in the
													possession of the Receiving Party before receipt from the Disclosing

													care, to prevent the duplication, disclosure or use of any such
													Confidential Information, other than (a) by or to its employees,
													agents and service providers who, in each case, must have access to
													such Confidential Information to perform the Receiving Party’s
													obligations under the Terms and who are each subject to obligations of
													confidentiality that are at least as stringent as those contained in
													the Terms or (b) as required by any law, regulation, or order of any
													court of proper jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter
													contained in the Terms, provided that, if legally permitted, the
													Receiving Party shall give the Disclosing Party prompt written notice
													and use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such disclosure
													is accorded confidential treatment. To the extent legally permitted,
													the Receiving Party will consult and cooperate with the Disclosing
													Party to obtain a protective order or other reliable assurance that
													confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information
													and will otherwise only disclose that portion of the Confidential
													Information that is required to be disclosed.  The Receiving Party is
													liable for its affiliates’, employees’, service providers’ and agents’
													compliance with the terms of this Section 12. Upon request, all copies
